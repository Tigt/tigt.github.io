# Early HTML

HTML took a while to become standardized, both officially and de-facto; the early days were merely enthusiastic programmers throwing around angle brackets and seeing what stuck. Everybody made up their own tags, because why not?

The very oldest piece of HTML we can find [is this snippet about hypertext](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Link.html "Hypertext Links"), circa <time datetime="1990-11-13">November 13<sup>th</sup>, 1990</time>:

```html
<title>Hypertext Links</title>
<h1>Links and Anchors</h1>
A link is the connection between one piece of
<a href=WhatIs.html>hypertext</a> and another.
```

If you slap `<!doctype html>` on top of it, [it validates](https://validator.nu/?doc=data%3Atext%2Fhtml%3Bcharset%3Dutf-8%2C%3C!doctype+html%3E%3Ctitle%3EHypertext+Links%3C%2Ftitle%3E+%3Ch1%3ELinks+and+Anchors%3C%2Fh1%3E+A+link+is+the+connection+between+one+piece+of+%3Ca+href%3DWhatIs.html%3Ehypertext%3C%2Fa%3E+and+another.)!

Near as we can tell, these early HTML pages are SGML with the file extension changed, and possibly the addition of hyperlink anchors.

### In the beginning ("HTML Tags")

There's a little more detail in [Tim's mailing list announcement of the work](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html).

We can see some tags that are alive today within HTML5:

* `<title>`
* `<a>`
* `<p>`
* `<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<h4>`/`<h5>`/`<h6>`
* `<address>`
* `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>`
* `<ul>`/`<li>`
* `<menu>` (which has recently been revived)

[Tim also mentions an upcoming, though unspecified "base address" tag](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html#11) that later became `<base>`. He also didn't really like using the `<h#>` system for numbering headings, instead [preferring to nest `<SECTION>` tags](https://adactio.com/journal/1683) His usage of them was mostly because [the flavor of SGML that CERN was using had them already](http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/sgmlhist.htm).

#### NeXT ID

```html
<NEXTID 22>
```

This bizarre, self-closing tag took a single attribute, apparently a number. Nobody's really sure what it did, but it almost certainly had something to do with the NeXTStep operating system Tim Berners-Lee started the WWW project on. Presumably it was something for the built-in editor to keep track of pages with, since the original dream was that all pages on the WWW would be editable by defaultâ€”like a wiki.

#### Example code

```html
<XMP>		<LISTING>
			...
		</LISTING>

</XMP>
```

> The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least 80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING. The examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.

Why the name? [Horrible prehistory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listing_%28computer%29) Browsers still support this element, which makes me wish it was still valid; escaping all my `&lt;`s can be a real pain.

If you wanted to implement its behavior, you could do like this:

```css
xmp {
  min-width: 80ch;
}
```

### Highlighted phrases

The `<hp1>`, `<hp2>`, `<hp3>`, and `<hp4>` tags are cut from the same cloth as `<h1>` and friends, but may have worked slightly differently; instead of wrapping their contents like normal tags, they would have affected all of the text following them, like [ANSI escape codes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#graphics), or mIRC's extensions to ASCII IRC clients. These "streaming tags" make sense from a [Unix text-processing perspective](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html), but can you imagine how hairy they would be today?
