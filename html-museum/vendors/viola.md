# Viola extensions

The [ViolaWWW browser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW) was briefly on top of the world as the official recommended browser at CERN. It was named after the scripting language it was implemented in, Viola: Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application.

Most notably, it implemented scripting, stylesheets, and embedded programs long before they ever arrived to HTML proper. (The current version was HTML 3.0.)

Viola was overtaken by Mosaic, on account of Mosaic being compatible with computers people actually used. You know, like Windows.

### Stylesheets

Stylesheets were attached using a rather familiar mechanism...

```html
<LINK REL="style" HREF="../../viola/sgml/styles/HTML_sodium.stg">
```

I can't seem to dig up what an `.stg` file is.
