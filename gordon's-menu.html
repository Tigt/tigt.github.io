<section>
	<h1>Tastes</h1>
	<p>Gordon can add a Taste to any item he prepares. Tasty Snacks must have the same Taste as their basic flavor. As long as you don't dislike the Taste, you gain its effects alongside the main effect. It doesn't say, but I assume these effects last until the end of the Scene.</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Salty</td>
				<td>Gain 5 temporary HP. This stacks with other Chef features and Digestion Buffs.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Spicy</td>
				<td>Increase Critical Hit Range by +1.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sour</td>
				<td>Increase Evasion against damaging attacks by +1.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Dry</td>
				<td>Increase Effect Range by +1.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bitter</td>
				<td>+1 bonus to all Save Checks.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sweet</td>
				<td>Increase Initiative by +5.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>Complex Aftertaste</h2>
	<p>Whenever you use a Digestion Buff that had a Taste, Gordon can spend 1 AP to give you a new Digestion Buff that acts the same as a Tasty Snack of the same taste.</p>
