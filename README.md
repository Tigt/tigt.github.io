==============

My name is Taylor Hunt.

I used to be an artist, then became a web developer, and now I’m realizing I shouldn’t have stopped with the art.

- I used to [write a lot on Codepen](https://codepen.io/tigt/posts/?grid_type=list), but now that’s deprecated. [I’ve written a bit on `dev.to`](https://dev.to/tigt) since, but in the long run I probably want to stop depending on other services for my writing.

- [My old art blog](https://tigt.tumblr.com), which was also where I learned how to HTML+CSS well enough to get a job later. (And unfortunately, some code in my custom theme was later deemed verboten by Tumblr, so I can’t update it.)
